# VLM Reality Check — Bias Taxonomy Configuration
# Each bias defines: difficulty_split (must sum to 1.0), ground_truth_method, target_challenge_count

texture:
  name: Texture Bias
  description: >
    Tests whether VLMs rely on surface texture rather than object shape
    for recognition. Pairs real photos with silhouette versions.
  difficulty_split:
    easy: 0.30
    medium: 0.50
    hard: 0.20
  ground_truth_method: silhouette_match
  target_challenge_count: 10000

counting:
  name: Counting Bias
  description: >
    Tests whether VLMs can accurately count objects, especially
    above the subitizing limit (~4 objects).
  difficulty_split:
    easy: 0.30
    medium: 0.50
    hard: 0.20
  ground_truth_method: yolo_count
  target_challenge_count: 10000

spatial_relations:
  name: Spatial Relations Bias
  description: >
    Tests whether VLMs correctly perceive spatial orientation
    and left/right/above/below relationships.
  difficulty_split:
    easy: 0.30
    medium: 0.50
    hard: 0.20
  ground_truth_method: flip_detection
  target_challenge_count: 10000

physical_plausibility:
  name: Physical Plausibility Bias
  description: >
    Tests whether VLMs can detect physically impossible lighting/shadow
    configurations using astropy-verified solar geometry.
  difficulty_split:
    easy: 0.30
    medium: 0.50
    hard: 0.20
  ground_truth_method: astropy_shadow
  target_challenge_count: 10000

temporal_reasoning:
  name: Temporal Reasoning Bias
  description: >
    Tests whether VLMs can order images chronologically based on
    lighting, construction progress, and temporal cues.
  difficulty_split:
    easy: 0.30
    medium: 0.50
    hard: 0.20
  ground_truth_method: exif_timestamp
  target_challenge_count: 10000

spurious_correlation:
  name: Spurious Correlation Bias
  description: >
    Tests whether VLMs change object identification based on
    background context (typical vs atypical settings).
  difficulty_split:
    easy: 0.30
    medium: 0.50
    hard: 0.20
  ground_truth_method: yolo_label_match
  target_challenge_count: 10000

compositional_binding:
  name: Compositional Binding Bias
  description: >
    Tests whether VLMs correctly bind attributes (color, size)
    to specific objects rather than swapping bindings.
  difficulty_split:
    easy: 0.30
    medium: 0.50
    hard: 0.20
  ground_truth_method: color_histogram_bbox
  target_challenge_count: 10000

text_in_image:
  name: Text-in-Image Bias
  description: >
    Tests whether VLMs can read and reason about visible text
    in images (signs, labels, addresses).
  difficulty_split:
    easy: 0.30
    medium: 0.50
    hard: 0.20
  ground_truth_method: ocr_text
  target_challenge_count: 10000

scale_invariance:
  name: Scale Invariance Bias
  description: >
    Tests whether VLMs recognize objects at different scales
    and distinguish recognition from size estimation.
  difficulty_split:
    easy: 0.30
    medium: 0.50
    hard: 0.20
  ground_truth_method: zoom_factor
  target_challenge_count: 10000
